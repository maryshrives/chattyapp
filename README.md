# Welcome to Chatty! :speech_balloon:

This is a simple chat application built using React, WebSockets, and WebPack. Multiple users can connect and chat in real time! All users can see the list of messages in the current conversation and see a notification if a user changes their username.

To get started:
1. clone the repo
2. run `npm install` in the root directory
3. open a second terminal window and cd into the chatty-server directory
4. run `npm install` again
5. use the command `npm start` in both terminal windows to get chatting!
